ðŸ”¹ Project Plan for Bird Monitoring Data Analysis
Phase 1: Data Understanding & Preparation
âœ… Load the datasets
âœ… Explore structure, missing values, and duplicates
âœ… Clean & preprocess data
âœ… Store cleaned data in an SQLite database

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
âœ… Dataset Overview (Total Observations, Unique Bird Species)
âœ… Top 10 Most Observed Bird Species
âœ… Temporal Analysis (Year-wise, Month-wise, Time-of-day trends)
âœ… Spatial Analysis (Admin Units, Locations, Biodiversity hotspots)
âœ… Species Behavior (Activity types, Sex ratio, Flyover analysis)
âœ… Environmental Factors (Temperature, Humidity, Wind, Sky impact)
âœ… Conservation Focus (Watchlist status, Regional stewardship)

Phase 3: Interactive Dashboard Development
âœ… Build a Streamlit app with Plotly visualizations
âœ… Create Power BI dashboard for additional insights

Phase 4: Documentation & Reporting
âœ… Write a concise report summarizing key findings
âœ… Provide recommendations for conservation strategies


âœ… Loads the cleaned dataset (forest & grassland data)
âœ… Stores it in an SQLite database
âœ… Creates separate tables for each dataset
âœ… Allows efficient querying for analysis


Store Bird Data Sqlite
âœ… SQLite database script is ready

EDA:
âœ… Species Distribution: Identify the most observed species per habitat
âœ… Observer Trends: Find out which observers recorded the most data
âœ… Flyover Behavior: Analyze how many observations were flyovers
âœ… Seasonal Patterns: Detect trends across different months and years
âœ… Environmental Impact: Study how temperature, humidity, and disturbances affect observations

ðŸ“Œ Streamlit App Features:
âœ… Dataset Overview

Display Total Observations, Unique Species, Top 10 Most Observed Species
Dropdown filters for Year, Location, Species, Observer
âœ… Visualization Components

Bar charts & Pie charts for Species Distribution, Observer Trends, and Habitat Type
Scatter plots for Environmental Conditions vs. Species Observations
Temporal Heatmaps for Yearly & Monthly Observations
Histograms for Start_Time & End_Time distributions
Geographic Mapping (if coordinates available)
âœ… Custom Theming

Nature-inspired colors, icons, and background images
Hover tooltips & interactive legends
